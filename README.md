Data products and tools for gas flaring analysis

## Mission
Build reproducible, open data products and lightweight tools to monitor and analyze gas flaring across Africa. Prioritize satellite-derived flare volumes, policy-relevant metrics, and low-cost deliverables for NGOs, regulators, and researchers.

## Short objectives
- Collect authoritative datasets (World Bank GFMR, IEA, satellite sources).
- Produce cleaned CSVs and simple dashboards.
- Maintain reproducible pipelines and clear provenance.
